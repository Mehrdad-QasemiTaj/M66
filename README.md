## Getting Started

1. Insert a micro SIM card into the SIM card holder.
2. Selecting serial communication pins using jumpers. 
3. Install the **CH340** driver if it's not already installed.
4. Press the **PWRKEY** button for 1 second to turn on the SIM800C module.
5. There are two ways to communicate with the module :
- Using a on board **USB to serial** converter for direct communicate with M66 module and Use any serial terminal (like PuTTY or hterm) to communicate with the module via AT commands.
- Using a pin header for communication **MCU** with M66 module.

## Notes

![M66](Images/M66DevBoard-9.jpg)

- To use the converter, the jumpers must be connected in such a way that TX is connected to cRX and RX is connected to cTX.
- To communicate with the MCU, jumpers must be set so that TX is connected to uRX and RX is connected to uTX.
```
TX  -> Module Transmit pin
RX  -> Module Receive pin
uRX -> Microcontroller Receive pin
uTX -> Microcontroller Transmit pin
cRX -> CH340n Receive pin
cTX -> CH340n Transmit pin
```
- The MCURX and MCUTX pins must be connected exactly to the RX and TX pins of the microcontroller and not MCURX to TX and MCUTX to RX.
```

MCUTX pin --- Microcontroller RX pin
MCURX pin --- Microcontroller TX pin

‚úÖ
MCUTX pin --- Microcontroller TX pin
MCURX pin --- Microcontroller RX pin
